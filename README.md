# pyknit

Transfer an image into the knitting domain as shown here:

![cat_and_grid](https://github.com/homerjed/pyknit/blob/main/imgs/cat_and_grid.png)

This is done by breaking the image into separate bins of pixel density as shown below:

In practise, a grid helps with the knitting. This is added and shown in the image below:
